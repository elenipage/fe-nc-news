# NC News Web App

## About the Project

This is an "NC News" web app which presents articles as well as their comments, and allows the user to vote on an article, leave comments, filter by topic, and sort articles. 

This app uses the API I created for the back-end of this project (you can access the API [here](https://github.com/elenipage/nc-news-backend)). 

You can view the deployed app [here](https://elenipage-nc-news.netlify.app)!

## Using the app

If using the app in the browser, you can use the 'topics' toggle or the 'all articles' toggle to navigate to a list of articles.

You can filter by topic, and sort the articles as you wish.

When you select an article, you can view the article and its comments, and you can cast your vote.

If you'd like to leave a comment, you'll need to log-in first, so navigate to the profile page to select who you'd like to log in as.

You can delete a comment you posted if you've changed your mind by clicking the delete button.
